Planned Features(to be completed by 2023):

Custom Profiles
Game Achievement Tracking
Server and Across Server Leaderboards
More Music Functionality: links from other music websites such as spotify, pitch control, speed control, cross channel output and more
Administrative Commands
Reaction Roles
Polls
Server Statistics
Report To Admin

Features that would be nice but no guarantee on actually happening:

Website: Nothing to host on though might have something later
Voice Commands: difficult with the discord api possibly not allowing it
Economy: A lot of commands a lot of time to do (considering there are a ton of economy bots, there is probably no point to this)

Finished:
Text and Voice Chat Leveling
