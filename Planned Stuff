Planned Features:

Custom Profiles
Game Achievement Tracking
Guild Unique leaderboard
More Music Functionality: links from other music websites such as spotify, pitch control, speed control, cross channel output and more
Administrative Commands
Reaction Roles
Server Statistics
Reports and warnings.

Features that would be nice but no guarantee on actually happening:

Website: Nothing to host on though might have something later
Voice Commands: difficult with the discord api possibly not allowing it
Economy: A lot of commands a lot of time to do (considering there are a ton of economy bots, there is probably no point to this)

Finished:
Text and Voice Chat Leveling
Global Leaderboard
